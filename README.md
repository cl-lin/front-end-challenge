### `Notes on this challenge`
I was not able to get the hover effect on the arrow.svg to work (prior to me separating the arrow from the teacher/student <a> tag) and I wasn't able to figure out how to change my test so that it runs on React 18. Otherwise everything else should be working correctly as shown from the figma file and the instructions from GitHub.
